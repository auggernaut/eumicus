## Tips for Effective Learning

1. **Be Specific:** Instead of "learn programming," try "learn Python for data analysis"
2. **Regular Sessions:** Short, frequent sessions work better than long ones
3. **Reflect Honestly:** Take time with reflection questions
4. **Review Progress:** Check your learning profile regularly
5. **Connect Concepts:** Look for relationships between different topics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not configured"**
- Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file
- Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root

**"Session failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
- Try a simpler learning goal

**"Memory not updating"**
- Check file permissions in the `data/` directory
- Ensure the `data/` directory exists
- Restart the application

### Getting Help

- Check the README for detailed setup instructions
- Review the console output for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
